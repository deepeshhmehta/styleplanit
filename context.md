## 5. Current Project Status

The project recently underwent a significant restructuring based on new wireframes. The initial single-page design was split into:
1.  A new homepage (`index.html`) featuring a slideshow hero, a "How it Works" section, customer testimonials, and a subscription form.
2.  A dedicated `services.html` page that reuses the tabbed interface from the original design to display the full "Collection" of services.

All HTML and CSS have been updated to reflect this new structure and the muted sage color palette. The site is responsive.
