## 5. Current Project Status

The project recently underwent a significant restructuring based on new wireframes. The initial single-page design was split into:
1.  A new homepage (`index.html`) featuring a slideshow hero, a "How it Works" section, customer testimonials, and a subscription form.
2.  A dedicated `services.html` page that reuses the tabbed interface from the original design to display the full "Collection" of services.

All HTML and CSS have been updated to reflect this new structure and the muted sage color palette. The site is responsive.

Following the restructure, a round of CEO feedback (Feb 2026) was implemented:
*   **Color Theme:** The website's color palette was updated to a "Eucalyptus Sage" theme, with a dark green accent and light green background.
*   **Hero Section:** The hero banner was made smaller (70vh), the image carousel was replaced with a static, three-image layout, and the CTA button was updated to "Discover Yours," linking to the "How It Works" section.
*   **"How It Works" Section:** This section was updated to a three-step process: "1- Checkout our services" (with service cards updated with a 200px border-radius), "2. Book a call with us" (linking to a Calendly page), and "3. Start the program you deserve."
*   **"As Seen On" Banner:** The background color was made bolder.
*   **Reviews Section:** The grid was made scrollable to accommodate more reviews.
*   **Icon Service Section:** The design was updated to align with the new color theme.
*   **Footer:** The font size of the main footer banner text was increased to 9rem.
