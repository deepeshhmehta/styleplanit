      "text": "I sought out a personal stylist because I felt like my wardrobe needed a refresh\u2014I had a lot of pieces I liked individually, but they didn\u2019t always come together in a way that felt cohesive or flattering. Working with Ayushi completely changed that. Before our sessions, my style was a bit all over the place. I had clothes I loved but didn\u2019t always know how to wear or pair them. Ayushi helped me understand what flatters my body and how to create outfits that feel more *me*. I now have clarity on how to dress in a way that\u2019s both comfortable and expressive of who I am.\nMy favorite part of the styling experience was seeing everything come together in the end. It was amazing to realize that I didn\u2019t need to overhaul my entire closet\u2014just learn how to use what I already had in smarter ways. One of the biggest surprises was how some simple changes in outfit combinations made a noticeable difference in how put-together and confident I looked.\nThroughout the process, I felt completely seen and supported. Ayushi really listened to what I liked and disliked, and found ways to incorporate pieces outside my usual style without pushing me to give up things I loved. It felt collaborative, not prescriptive.\nThe outfits we put together made me feel confident, comfortable, and like a more intentional version of myself. Friends and family noticed subtle but impactful changes, often complimenting how I carried myself or how certain outfits flattered me more.\nI\u2019d absolutely recommend this experience\u2014especially to anyone whose wardrobe feels stuck or disconnected from who they are now. Whether you're unsure of what suits you or just need a fresh perspective, working with Ayushi can be incredibly grounding and enlightening.\nThree words to describe this journey: *comfortable, insightful, and supportive.*\nThis experience didn\u2019t just change how I dress\u2014it changed how I approach getting dressed every day. I feel more confident, more aligned with my personal style, and most importantly, more at ease with the way I show up in the world."

She was very supportive throughout out the process, right from making sure the picture is right to ensuring I had my PDF in my email. I loved how detailed the analysis was - especially the mention of something as minute as a lipshade that would go with my complexion as well. There was an entire moodboard of clothes to help me understand, the kind of colours I should opt for! I am glad I was able to get this done with her and am super happy with her report."

She pays attention to your comfort, thoughts and will give you lot of options. At every step she will ask if you are okay with the progress and if not, she will work her magic and come up with solutions that one couldn\u2019t imagine.\nShe helped me style for a baby shower recently. Her attention to intricate details about the theme of the function, mood of the weather, everyone dressing around was just amazing. I remember laughing when she told me to keep weather in mind but i realised later how important that thought was. On the day, i literally knew what to wear and what makeup to do. Life couldn\u2019t have been simpler on that day. \nJust a wonderful person with amazing talent\u2026 loved her work."

We started with an initial video call where I showed her the saree I had in mind, along with the jewelry and shoes I already owned. From just that, she created a thoughtful mood board that brought the whole vision together. At first, I was planning to wear a pink saree, but I didn\u2019t have the right blouse \u2014 so began the hunt for a ready-made one. I video-called Ayushi from the store and showed her all the options, but unfortunately nothing did justice to the saree. Instead of forcing it, she calmly helped me pivot and explore brand-new saree options. She explained that I fall into the *spring* color season and guided me on what shades to look for. While I was shopping, I kept video-calling her to show saree options, and she balanced her expert eye with my personal preferences so beautifully. We finally chose a teal dual satin saree \u2014 and she was kind enough to create an entirely new mood board for this look too, complete with hairstyle options and styling details. The final look turned out so good! I felt confident, put-together, and got so many compliments.Thank you, Ayushi, for your patience, creativity, and all the hard work you put into making me feel my best.
